-   [x] refactor to manual routing instead of file-based routing, so that all file structure lives
        in clearly defined co-located parts.
-   [ ] create simple MVP playwright tests for creating a list, adding some items, getting the share
        link, signing out and signing back in as another user in response to clicking the share
        link, being able to see the list in 'shared lists' and then being able to click into it and
        mark things as purchased.
